> **After Apply, you must click Restart or the inject does not take effect.** Apply only writes the prompt and patches to disk. This process is still the old one. When the host has restarted, start a new chat — that is when the inject enters the session. Apply alone looks like nothing was injected.

> Current target is **dsh 0.1.7-rc.2**. The previous target, **0.1.7-rc.1** (including `0.1.7-rc.1.20260924.1`), still matches (Node.js **≥18**; Windows no-flash import hooks need **Node ≥22** `registerHooks`, older Node still gets file-level `windowsHide` patches). Patterns from older host builds that no longer exist are not applied. On other versions, unmatched originals stay pending or skipped. Nothing is rewritten blindly. Also accepts the 0.1.2 community `dsh-persona text` field and `dsh-mnemon` v0 session `summary`. After install you still need **Apply + restart**.

## What this is

**dsh-purge** is a cybersecurity red-team plugin for the official [DeepSeek Harness](https://www.deepseek.com/harness/) already installed on your machine.

Harness does more than forward a prompt. It rewrites prompts, approval gates, sandbox policy, and session migration at runtime. Asking only “will the model answer” treats a host-layer block as a model refusal. This plugin separates those two layers on your own install, for controlled evaluation and for seeing which default policy is too tight.

| You get | What it does |
|---|---|
| **dsh-purge dock** | A button beside the session title opens the right dock. Two pages: Clean and Drill |
| **Clean** | Grouped patch status, Apply / Restore / Uninstall, prompt editor, multiple rule sets |
| **Drill** | Built into the stable release. After authorization: assets, skills, and the local environment. Only for a host you manage, an offline target, or a written authorized exercise |
| **Host policy** | Default copy, permission policy, and tool limits. Official capabilities stay. No second invented identity |
| **On start** | Checks and reapplies. After npm overwrites `node_modules`, you do not hand-edit files |

No hardcoded drive letters. It looks at `$DSH_HOME`, `.dsh` next to the dsh launcher, then `~/.dsh`. It does not patch the Harness source tree. **Apply** on the **Clean** page of **dsh-purge** is what writes the changes. Identity comes only from your `prompt-inject.md`.

It only touches the official `@deepseek-ai` packages and local config on the user's machine. It is not a public scanner and not an attack kit for third-party sites. The repo does not ship malware, unauthorized-exploit scripts, or payloads aimed at the public internet.

The project does not supply illegal content and does not incite, organize, or assist crime.
2. **Local official Harness only.** Security-eval patches and prompt injection run only on the **official DeepSeek Harness already installed on the user's machine** (`@deepseek-ai` packages, local profile / `$DSH_HOME`). The target is the user's own official local software, **not** someone else's website, server, account, or information system.

They **do not scan, probe, intrude, or send attack traffic to any public host or unauthorized system**. Do not use this project as a jump host against the public internet. If "check for updates" is on, the plugin may only contact this plugin's own GitHub repository to compare versions. That is **not** an attack on third-party systems and is **not** authorization to penetrate anything.
4. **Lawful, controlled scope.** This project is an aid for red-team research and robustness evaluation on an **official Harness the user is entitled to administer**. **Do not run it against targets without the owner's lawful written authorization, public online systems, or production workloads.** Testing must stay on the **authorized local official Harness, offline local synthetic fixtures, authorized cybersecurity ranges, and compliant lab environments**.

## Install

Web, community Desktop, and the official desktop EXE are **installed and patched separately**. Install only the host you have open.

| What you run | Profile | Go to |
|---|---|---|
| Official `dsh web` | `web` | [Web](#web) |
| Community [DSH Desktop](https://github.com/anywhere-labs/dsh-desktop) | `desktop` | [Community Desktop](#desktop) |
| Official Harness desktop EXE | `default` | [Official desktop EXE](#official-exe) |

If `dsh` is not on PATH, or you do not want a remote install, use [Manual install](#manual).

### After the command: three steps

Adding the plugin to a profile does **not** patch `@deepseek-ai` by itself.

1. **Quit and reopen** the host you just installed into. Stop `dsh web` and start it again, or quit the Desktop tray and open that app's exe.
2. On **that host**, click **dsh-purge** beside the session title, then click **Apply** on the **Clean** page. This plugin does not appear on the host Settings page.
3. **Restart once more** when prompted. Patched files load on that next start. Restart happens only when you click it.

Web **Apply / Restart / Uninstall** affect Web only. Desktop controls affect the desktop app only and do not launch `dsh web`. Do not Apply one host from the other.

<a id="web"></a>

### Web

Official `dsh` must be on PATH. If it is not, install the official CLI or use manual install.

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add https://github.com/YuJunZhiXue/dsh-purge/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz
```

If this directory is already a clone:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add .
```

Then follow the three steps above. Click **dsh-purge** beside the session title and **Apply** on **Clean**.

<a id="desktop"></a>

### Community Desktop

Open [DSH Desktop](https://github.com/anywhere-labs/dsh-desktop) and run this in the **built-in terminal**. That `dsh` is the desktop wrapper; its default profile is `desktop`.

```sh
dsh plugin add https://github.com/YuJunZhiXue/dsh-purge/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz
```

Do not use official `dsh plugin --profile desktop` on PATH (it is rejected). Do not use `dsh://` (that protocol belongs to the official EXE).

Then quit the tray, reopen `DSH Desktop.exe`, click **dsh-purge** beside the session title, and **Apply** on **Clean**.

For a custom install folder, set `$exe` in the script to `DSH Desktop.exe` in that folder. The tarball URL is the source so a local path with spaces cannot split the command.

<details>
<summary><strong>Install from system PowerShell</strong></summary>

Find `DSH Desktop.exe` from the running process or the default locations below. Do not scan the whole disk.

```powershell
$zip = "https://github.com/YuJunZhiXue/dsh-purge/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz"
$exe = (Get-Process -Name "DSH Desktop" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -First 1 -ExpandProperty Path)
if (-not $exe) {
  $exe = @(
    "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\DSH Desktop\DSH Desktop.exe",
    "$env:ProgramFiles\DSH Desktop\DSH Desktop.exe",
    "${env:ProgramFiles(x86)}\DSH Desktop\DSH Desktop.exe"
  ) | Where-Object { Test-Path -LiteralPath $_ } | Select-Object -First 1
}
if (-not $exe) { throw "DSH Desktop.exe not found. Start the app, or set `$exe` to the exe in the install folder." }
$cli = @(
  (Join-Path (Split-Path $exe) "resources\app\lib\desktop-cli.js"),
  (Join-Path (Split-Path $exe) "resources\app.asar.unpacked\lib\desktop-cli.js")
) | Where-Object { Test-Path -LiteralPath $_ } | Select-Object -First 1
$env:ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE = "1"
$env:DSH_DESKTOP_DEFAULT_PROFILE = "desktop"
& $exe --expose-internals $cli plugin add $zip
```

</details>

<a id="official-exe"></a>

### Official desktop EXE

If the **official DeepSeek Harness desktop client** is installed, use the command or the button (`dsh://`). Community DSH Desktop does **not** handle that protocol — use the previous section. Current patches target **0.1.7-rc.2**. The **0.1.7-rc.1** anchors are still there.

```sh
dsh plugin --profile default add https://github.com/YuJunZhiXue/dsh-purge/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz

</details>

Then fully quit the official client, including the tray, and open it again.

On the official desktop, click **Apply**, then restart.

### How to tell it installed

- **dsh-purge** sits beside the session title, and **Apply** is on its Clean page
- `/purge status` in chat prints `DSH_HOME` and the patch list; the path should be the home you are actually running
- Optional packages that are not installed (liangshen) show as skipped and do not block Apply

### Hand this to an assistant

Paste the block below to a local assistant. It should only run the install command: no full-disk scan, no other file edits, no Apply, no restart.

<details>
<summary><strong>For AI assistants (install only)</strong></summary>

<!-- AI-AGENT-START -->

Install the DeepSeek Harness plugin `dsh-purge`. Confirm the host first and install only that one. Do not scan the whole disk, do not read or edit other files, do not apply settings, and do not restart the app.

**Web (official `dsh web`)**

If `dsh` is not on PATH, tell the user and stop.

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add https://github.com/YuJunZhiXue/dsh-purge/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz
```

If this directory is already a clone, use `dsh plugin --profile web add .`.

**Desktop (community DSH Desktop)**

Do not use official `dsh plugin --profile desktop` on PATH. Do not use `dsh://`.

Default: already inside Desktop’s built-in terminal:

```sh
dsh plugin add https://github.com/YuJunZhiXue/dsh-purge/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz
```

From a system terminal: use the running `DSH Desktop` process Path, or the default locations `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\DSH Desktop\DSH Desktop.exe`, `%ProgramFiles%\DSH Desktop\DSH Desktop.exe`. Do not scan the whole disk. Then:

```powershell
$zip = "https://github.com/YuJunZhiXue/dsh-purge/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz"
$exe = (Get-Process -Name "DSH Desktop" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -First 1 -ExpandProperty Path)
if (-not $exe) {
  $exe = @(
    "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\DSH Desktop\DSH Desktop.exe",
    "$env:ProgramFiles\DSH Desktop\DSH Desktop.exe",
    "${env:ProgramFiles(x86)}\DSH Desktop\DSH Desktop.exe"
  ) | Where-Object { Test-Path -LiteralPath $_ } | Select-Object -First 1
}
if (-not $exe) { Write-Host "DSH Desktop.exe not found. Start the app or give the install folder."; return }
$cli = @(
  (Join-Path (Split-Path $exe) "resources\app\lib\desktop-cli.js"),
  (Join-Path (Split-Path $exe) "resources\app.asar.unpacked\lib\desktop-cli.js")
) | Where-Object { Test-Path -LiteralPath $_ } | Select-Object -First 1
$env:ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE = "1"
$env:DSH_DESKTOP_DEFAULT_PROFILE = "desktop"
& $exe --expose-internals $cli plugin add $zip
```

**Official Harness desktop EXE**

```sh
dsh plugin --profile default add https://github.com/YuJunZhiXue/dsh-purge/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz
```

After the command finishes, tell the user to fully quit and restart the host they just installed into, then open **dsh-purge** beside the session title and **Apply** on **Clean**. Do not Apply Web from Desktop or Desktop from Web. Then stop.

<!-- AI-AGENT-END -->

</details>

<a id="manual"></a>

### Manual install

Use this when the command fails, `dsh` is not on `PATH`, or you do not want a remote install. Edit **only the profile for the host you are using**. Do **not** delete existing bundles. Do not edit Web and Desktop in the same pass.

**0. Pick one host, one profile**

| What you actually run | Edit only this directory | Leave alone |
|---|---|---|
| Official `dsh web` | `$DSH_HOME/profiles/web` | `desktop`, `default` |
| Community [DSH Desktop](https://github.com/anywhere-labs/dsh-desktop) | `$DSH_HOME/profiles/desktop` | `web`, `default` |
| Official Harness desktop EXE | `$DSH_HOME/profiles/default` | `web`, `desktop` |

If `profiles/<name>/package.json` is missing, start that host once so the official program creates the profile, then continue.

**1. Find the `$DSH_HOME` this host actually uses**

A real home is named `.dsh` (official EXE sometimes uses `dsh-home`), contains `profiles`, and has at least one `profiles/<name>/package.json`.

Search in this order and use the first tree that matches the host you run:

| Order | Layout | Typical path |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Environment | `DSH_HOME` if set |
| 2 | Windows portable / install folder | `.dsh` next to `dsh.cmd` or `npm-global`, for example `<install root>\.dsh` |
| 3 | User default | Windows `%USERPROFILE%\.dsh`; Linux / macOS `~/.dsh` |
| 4 | Official desktop EXE | `%APPDATA%\DeepSeek Harness\dsh-home`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DeepSeek Harness\dsh-home` |

PowerShell can list candidates:

```powershell
$cands = @()
if ($env:DSH_HOME) { $cands += $env:DSH_HOME }
$cands += "$env:USERPROFILE\.dsh"
$dsh = Get-Command dsh -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
if ($dsh) {
  $dir = Split-Path $dsh.Source
  $cands += @(
    (Join-Path $dir ".dsh"),
    (Join-Path (Split-Path $dir) ".dsh"),
    (Join-Path (Split-Path (Split-Path $dir)) ".dsh")
  )
}
$cands += @(
  "$env:APPDATA\DeepSeek Harness\dsh-home",
  "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\DeepSeek Harness\dsh-home"
)
$cands | Select-Object -Unique | Where-Object { $_ -and (Test-Path (Join-Path $_ "profiles")) }
```

How to confirm you found the right one:

- Web: `$DSH_HOME/profiles/web/package.json` has `"name": "dsh-profile-web"`
- Community Desktop: `$DSH_HOME/profiles/desktop/package.json` has `"name": "dsh-profile-desktop"`
- Official EXE: `$DSH_HOME/profiles/default/package.json` exists

Machines often have two homes (user folder and install folder). A portable / install-dir official `dsh` uses the `.dsh` next to the install root — not an empty `%USERPROFILE%\.dsh`. After the steps below, start the host that belongs to that home.

**2. Put the plugin at `$DSH_HOME/plugins/dsh-purge`**

The tree must look like this (do not rename the folder):

```
$DSH_HOME/
  plugins/
    dsh-purge/                 ← must be named dsh-purge
      package.json             ← "name" must be "dsh-purge"
      client.js
      cordis.patch.yml
      lib/
  profiles/
    web/package.json           ← or desktop / default
```

With git:

```sh
mkdir -p "$DSH_HOME/plugins"
git clone https://github.com/YuJunZhiXue/dsh-purge.git "$DSH_HOME/plugins/dsh-purge"
```

Without git, download [master.tar.gz](https://github.com/YuJunZhiXue/dsh-purge/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz), extract it, rename `dsh-purge-master` to `dsh-purge`, and place that folder under `plugins`. PowerShell example (set `$home` to the path from step 1):

```powershell
$home = $(if ($env:DSH_HOME) { $env:DSH_HOME } else { Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE ".dsh" })
$plugins = Join-Path $home "plugins"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $plugins | Out-Null
$tmp = Join-Path $env:TEMP "dsh-purge-master.tar.gz"
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/YuJunZhiXue/dsh-purge/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz" -OutFile $tmp
tar -xzf $tmp -C $plugins
$src = Join-Path $plugins "dsh-purge-master"
$dst = Join-Path $plugins "dsh-purge"
if (Test-Path $dst) { Remove-Item -Recurse -Force $dst }
Rename-Item $src "dsh-purge"
```

If you already have a clone, copy the whole tree to `$DSH_HOME/plugins/dsh-purge`. Do not copy a few `.js` files by themselves.

Check: `$DSH_HOME/plugins/dsh-purge/package.json` opens and `"name": "dsh-purge"`. Do not use the Hub `api/plugins/download` URL as the source.

**3. Edit only that profile’s `package.json` — back it up first**

| Host | File to edit |
|---|---|
| Web | `$DSH_HOME/profiles/web/package.json` |
| Community Desktop | `$DSH_HOME/profiles/desktop/package.json` |
| Official desktop EXE | `$DSH_HOME/profiles/default/package.json` |

Copy `package.json.bak` first. Then **add only two things**. Keep every existing dependency, bundle, and other field:

1. In `dependencies`, add `"dsh-purge": "file:../../plugins/dsh-purge"`
2. At the **end** of `dsh.profile.bundles`, append `"dsh-purge"` (skip if it is already there)

`file:../../plugins/dsh-purge` is the relative path from `profiles/web` (or `desktop` / `default`) to `$DSH_HOME/plugins/dsh-purge`. The same relative path works for all three. Do not switch it to an absolute path.

Before (official default often looks like this; your file may list more plugins — keep them):

```json
{
  "name": "dsh-profile-web",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {},
  "dsh": {
    "profile": {
      "bundles": [
        "@deepseek-ai/dsh-base",
        "@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app"
      ],
      "patchReload": "live"
    }
  }
}
```

After:

```json
{
  "name": "dsh-profile-web",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "dsh-purge": "file:../../plugins/dsh-purge"
  },
  "dsh": {
    "profile": {
      "bundles": [
        "@deepseek-ai/dsh-base",
        "@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app",
        "dsh-purge"
      ],
      "patchReload": "live"
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:

- Web: **keep** `@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app`; only append this plugin
- Desktop: keep `@deepseek-ai/dsh-base` and the rest; if there is no `dsh-web-app` row, do not add one
- JSON must stay valid: a comma before the new item, no trailing comma after the last item
- Leave `patchReload`, other plugin names, and versions alone
- Do not write `"dsh-purge"` twice

**4. Run `pnpm install` only in the profile you just edited**

`pnpm` must be available (official `dsh` usually ships it). `cd` into **that profile directory**, not the repo root and not `$DSH_HOME` itself. Run only the block for your host. Do not run all three.

```sh
cd "$DSH_HOME/profiles/web"
pnpm install

cd "$DSH_HOME/profiles/desktop"
pnpm install

cd "$DSH_HOME/profiles/default"
pnpm install
```

PowerShell (use the home from step 1):

```powershell
cd "$env:USERPROFILE\.dsh\profiles\web"
# cd "$env:USERPROFILE\.dsh\profiles\desktop"
# cd "$env:USERPROFILE\.dsh\profiles\default"
# portable install: point DSH_HOME at that .dsh, do not hardcode a drive:
# cd "$env:DSH_HOME\profiles\web"
pnpm install
```

Success: `$DSH_HOME/profiles/<web|desktop|default>/node_modules/dsh-purge/package.json` exists.

Common failures:

- `pnpm` not found: install pnpm, or use the Node / pnpm that ships with official `dsh`
- `Could not resolve` / missing local package: check that `plugins/dsh-purge/package.json` exists and `file:../../plugins/dsh-purge` is correct
- JSON parse error: fix commas in `package.json` and retry; restore the backup if needed

**5. Fully quit that host, start it, then apply**

Writing `package.json` does **not** patch `@deepseek-ai` by itself. Restart, then click **Apply**.

1. Fully quit the host you just installed into: stop `dsh web`; quit the community Desktop tray and open `DSH Desktop.exe`; quit the official EXE tray as well
2. Open **that host**. **dsh-purge** should appear beside the session title. Open it to reach Clean.
3. Click **Apply** on this host only, or run `/purge apply` in chat. Do not Apply Web from Desktop or Desktop from Web
4. Restart again when prompted so patched packages load in this process. Settings **Restart / Uninstall** relaunch the desktop app; they do not launch `dsh web`

**6. How to confirm it is installed**

- **dsh-purge** sits beside the session title, and **Apply** is on its Clean page
- `/purge status` prints `DSH_HOME` and the patch list; the path should match step 1
- `profiles/<name>/node_modules/dsh-purge` points at `plugins/dsh-purge`

If the card is missing, you likely edited the other `.dsh`, or you edited `web` and then opened Desktop. Go back to step 1. Do not split the same install across two homes.

### Uninstall

**dsh-purge** beside the session title → **Clean** → **Uninstall**. Confirm the dialog: uninstall restores the original Harness and removes this plugin. If patches were applied, they are reverted first. The current host then restarts (Web relaunches `dsh web`; community Desktop relaunches `DSH Desktop.exe`).

```sh
# or from a terminal
dsh-purge --uninstall
# or in chat: /purge uninstall
```

Plugin config lives in `cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: dsh-purge
      name: 'dsh-purge'
      config:
        enabled: true
        autoApplyOnStart: true
        autoUpdateOnStart: false
        autoRevertOnMissing: false
        verbose: false
        postPromptOrder: 5100
        postPrompt: ""
```

`postPrompt` is empty by default.

## Preview

**dsh-purge** sits beside the session title. It opens a right-hand dock with two pages: **Clean** and **Drill**. Switch **Light / Ink**. Patches are grouped; the count only includes items that actually applied. Rule sets sit in a list above the editor, with Enable and Delete on each row.

The first time you open Drill you read the notice, wait out the countdown, scroll to the end, and check three boxes. Clean does not need that step. Drill is only for a host you manage, an offline target, or an exercise that already has written authorization.

**Clean**

**Drill authorization**

**Patches**

**Rule sets**

![Rule sets](docs/preview/rules.png)

| Area | What it shows |
|---|---|
| dsh-purge | button beside the session title; opens or collapses the dock |
| Clean | the old Rules page: patches, prompt, rule sets, skills |
| Drill | assets, skills, and environment after authorization. The tab says Unauthorized until then |
| Light / Ink | card appearance |
| Patches | grouped status, Apply, Restore, or Uninstall |
| Prompt | edit `prompt-inject.md` as the session override |
| Rule sets | multiple `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`; Enable writes under `$DSH_HOME`, Delete removes the row |
| Skills | import a zip or folder into this host’s official `$DSH_HOME/skills/<id>/SKILL.md` (web and desktop each use their own home; no drive letter is hardcoded); DSH owns match, load, and `/name`. You can also delete that folder yourself |

Runtime user files: `$DSH_HOME/prompt-inject.md`, `$DSH_HOME/rules/`, `$DSH_HOME/skills/`. If `DSH_HOME` is unset, the launcher-adjacent `.dsh` wins over `~/.dsh`. Skills are not part of the `dsh-purge` inject section and do not replace the prompt.

---

## Usage

```sh
dsh-purge --status
dsh-purge --apply
dsh-purge --revert
dsh-purge --uninstall
dsh-purge --edit

/purge status | apply | revert | uninstall | edit | help
/rules list | use <id> | create <id> | delete <id> | reset | help
/skills list | import <zip-or-folder> | create <id> [description] | delete <id> | help
/rewind

purge_status   purge_apply   purge_revert
```

Patched packages load only after a restart. Apply does not restart by itself. Under the patch title is the stable release: you can see versions and switch. A rollback is pinned; click **Update** to return to the latest. The beta channel is gone.

The composer **Undo** button drops the last turn and puts the last user sentence back in the input. On the main agent you can rewind once or the whole last round (including subagents). After rewind, send only what is in the box now. `/rewind` does the same. The host cannot truncate a session in place, so rewind opens another session for the shortened transcript and removes the old one from the sidebar. Repeating undo does not leave a stack of branches in the list.

## How it works

Apply, on start or when you click Apply:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["Start or click Apply"] --> B{"Patch already in place?"}
  B -->|yes| C["Skip"]
  B -->|no| D["Back up the original as .dshpurge.bak"]
  D --> E["Replace the matched files"]
  E --> F["Override the shim"]
  F --> G{"User edited the prompt?"}
  G -->|no| H["Write the built-in default prompt"]
  G -->|yes| I["Keep the current prompt-inject.md"]
```

Override on each session:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["New session"] --> B{"prompt-inject.md has text?"}
  B -->|yes| C["Write it verbatim into the dsh-purge systemPrompt section"]
  B -->|no| D["Do not write an override section"]
```

Skills stay out of the inject section:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["Settings import or /skills import"] --> B["Write into the official skills directory"]
  B --> C["DSH loads it"]
  C --> D["Uninstall does not delete user skills"]
```

---

## Restore

- Each target is copied to `<file>.dshpurge.bak` before the first apply.
- **Restore** or `/purge revert` copies backups back and deletes them. With no backup, shim lines written by this plugin are stripped.
- `prompt-inject.md` is a user file and is kept.
- **Uninstall** restores first if patches were applied, then deletes the inject file, rule library, and the plugin itself.
- Apply is idempotent.

---

## Path detection

The host surface is detected first: `web` / `desktop` (`gui` / `tui` are reserved and still fall back to web).

**Web:**

1. `DSH_HOME` / `DSH_BASE`
2. `.dsh` next to the dsh launcher (portable install, any drive)
3. `npm prefix -g` / `npm root -g`
4. Nested `@deepseek-ai/dsh/node_modules/@deepseek-ai`
5. `~/.dsh`

**Community DSH Desktop:** only the **running desktop process** install tree (`resources/app` or `app.asar.unpacked` → `@deepseek-ai`). The folder does not have to be named `DSH Desktop`, and the drive letter is not hard-coded. Order:

1. Running `DSH Desktop.exe` / `process.resourcesPath` / `host-process-entry.js` / `desktop-cli.js`
2. A `resources/app` tree whose parent folder actually contains `DSH Desktop.exe`
3. A path whose name contains `DSH Desktop` / `dsh-desktop`
4. `DSH_DESKTOP_INSTALL` (install root) or `DSH_BASE` (`@deepseek-ai` under that tree)
5. Common NSIS locations (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\DSH Desktop`, `%ProgramFiles%\DSH Desktop`, …)

Official npm-global is not patched. Sealed `host-commands` / `runtime-commands` are scrubbed, never injected.

If nothing is found, set `DSH_BASE` / `DSH_DESKTOP_INSTALL`. No files are changed.

---

## Releases

What changed, and the zip, are on [Releases](https://github.com/YuJunZhiXue/dsh-purge/releases). To publish, bump the version in `package.json`, write Chinese and English notes in `release-notes.md`, and push `master`. Pushing the same version again does not publish another package.

## Notes

- Scope is rendered copy, defaults, and runtime logic inside local `@deepseek-ai/*` packages, plus override files and rule sets under the harness home.
- After an upgrade, unmatched originals show as skipped. Apply still completes, and those files are left unchanged.
- Third-party plugin *source repos* outside `@deepseek-ai` are left alone (CMD silence may **best-effort** patch installed doctor / market / liangshen / mnemon at runtime).
- The npm package name is not published yet. Install from GitHub, the [Hub](https://deepseek.stream/plugins/dsh-purge), or `dsh plugin add .`.
